========================

Loodud Tarkvaraprojekti aine (MTAT.03.138) raames Tartu Ãœlikoolis 2014 aastal.

Project Setup:
========================

Get python version 3.4.1 (I got the 32-bit version) from https://www.python.org/downloads/. During your installation make sure you instal/check "Add python.exe to Path" and "pip". They should be in the same menu.

Next we're going to install a database. Go to http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows and install Postgres 9.3.5.1. Set postgres/postgres as username/password and leave the port to 5432. There is no need to do anything with StackBuilder at the end of the installation. Now open PgAdmin and create a new user role(right click PostgresSQL 9.3(localhost:5432) - New object - New login role. Set username/password as silmaring/silmaring and check the superuser checkbox.
Right click "Databases" - New Database.. (If you don't see it, click refresh.)  Name it also "silmaring" and set the owner to silmaring.

On command-line go to the direction you want to install the virtualenvironment and run
> python -m venv virtuanenv

This will create the virtual environment folder named "virtuanenv". Activate it by using the script in you new virtual-environment folder "virtuanenv\Scripts\activate". You should now see a name of the virtualenv in you commandline in brackets

Now we need to install psycopg2. Download the .exe file from http://stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/. While you have your virtualenv activated in cmd run
"easy_install psycopg2-2.5.4.win32-py3.4-pg9.3.5-release.exe"

(before running check this command - the .exe you downloaded may have slightly different name)

Do a git pull.

(Go to the folder where you have requirements.txt file.)

Now run these commands:
> pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

> python manage.py syncdb

(If you get "You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):" answer "no")

> python manage.py migrate

> python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:7000

After this if everything went as planned, you should have a server running and be able to access this url:
http://localhost:7000/api/randomthing/randomthing/.

If you see the form and can enter new persons then everything should be working.
(Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK. -- If your keyboard doesn't have "break", use "pause" instead.)
